# Bernie2020
Program created to see how many remaining delegates Bernie Sanders needs to influence the Democratic party platform in the Democratic Primaries. As he has dropped out and Biden has
officially become the Democratic Presidential nominee, I created this program for those interested in wanting to test out how many delegates Bernie would need to influence the
party platform. Enjoy!
